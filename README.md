# Web-Design-Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to design a static webpage using html and css/bootstrap. The web page highlights findings from the [Python-API-Challenge](https://github.com/asundquistdavis/Python-api-Challenge) which explored how weather varies with latitude. All of the data is exported from jupyter notebooks using the pandas.to_html feature which saves the dataframe formatted as an html table in a txt file. The visualizations are saved using the pandas.savefig method. The site is hosted using Github pages at [https://asundquistdavis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/](https://asundquistdavis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/).
